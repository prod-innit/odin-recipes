    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a simple crepe recipe I always use, based on 
        <a href="https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/classic-crepes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">BBC GoodFood's one</a>.
        I've tweaked it a bit, as I don't think the original is as good as it could be. 
        The best crepes are ones made with what you have, in the amounts you deem fit for what
        you like in a crepe. I'll put in the amounts I'd start with, but also include what to
        change and what to look for in order to make those changes. Bone apple tea!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>140g Plain Flour</li>
        <li>200ml Whole Milk</li>
        <li>2 Large Eggs</li>
        <li>25g Unsalted Butter</li>
        <li>1/2tsp Vanilla Extract</li>
        <li>Spray Oil or Melted Butter (for greasing)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Microwave the butter for 30 seconds, checking and stiring halfway through.</li>
        <li>Using a measuring jug, add the milk and 100ml of water and stir them together.</li>
        <li>Crack the eggs into the jug and whisk them in with the vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>Sift the flour with a pinch of salt into a medium-size bowl, then make a well in the middle.</li>
        <li>Add the wet ingredients into the well in a steady stream, whisking constantly and gradually incorporating the flour.</li>
    </ol>
